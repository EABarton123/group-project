    </h2>
    <p>
        Here at Karington Recipes we want to share healthy environment friendly recipes. All our recipes use organic
        ingredients that can be grown in the UK. We adapt our website for the seasons, so depending
        on what time of year it is all our recipes will be seasonal. Some items can be foraged (although this needs to
        be done
        with expert knowledge) and we encourage anyone who can to home grow as many ingredients as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are three food mad friends who have joined to share our favourite recipes. However with Climate change, food
        wastage, and international travel on the rise we want to go back to basics. We show that food can be nutricious,
        sustainable and not cost the earth. We hope you enjoy!
